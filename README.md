# Windi CLI - Windi CLI is my custom CLI to get Tailwindcss into my projects with only one command 
- This will use tailwindcss command but with very easy to use syntax ex:

'''
* bun run windi --init laravel -> It add tailwindcss to the project pregenerated for laravel 
'''

# TODO 
- implement init flag with all tailwind supported apps
- implement the help menu whit all the flags when user makes a bad flag or unknown command
